# Customised_Generic_Standard_Template_Library

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### The Project Customized Generic Data Structure Library ( CGSTL ) is an collection of data structure operations which are performed on the following data structures.

```
1. Singly Linear Linked List.
2. Singly Circular Linked List.
3. Doubly Linear Linked List.
4. Doubly Circular Linked List.
5. Stack Implementation using a Linked List.
6. Queue Implementation using a Linked List.
7. Doubly Ended Queue Implementation using An Linked List.
8. Binary Search Tree using Linked List.

By creating object of the respective class you can call respective class methods and perform operations mentioned below.
```

## The following operations can be performed on above data structures.

<br>

### -> On Linked List You Can Perform Following Operation:

1. Insert Element At First Position In Linked List.
2. Insert Element At Last Position In Linked List.
3. Insert Element At Desire Postion In Linked List.
4. Delete Element From First Position In Linked List.
5. Delete Element From Last Position In Linked List.
6. Delete Element From Desire Postion In Linked List.
7. Display Element From The Linked List.
8. Count Element From The Linked List.

<br>

### -> On Stack You Can Perform Following Operations:

1. Push Element In Stack.
2. Pop Element From Stack.
3. Display Stack Elements.
4. Count Stack Elements.

<br>

### ->On Queue You Can Perform Following Operations:

1. Enqueue Element In Stack.
2. Dequeue Element From Stack.
3. Display Stack Elements.
4. Count Stack Elements.

<br>

### ->On BST You Can Perform Following Operations:

1. Insert Nodes In BST.
2. Delete Nodes From BST.
3. Search Nodes In BST.
4. Display Tree In Inorder Traversal Manner.
5. Display Tree In Preorder Traversal Manner.
6. Display Tree In Postorder Traversal Manner.

## Steps To Use Project :

<br>1. Create a folder and place the CGSTL.h and Helper.cpp file together with the desire file in which you want to include Header file. i.e. CGSTL.h.

<br>2. While creating a object of the class you need to specify the datatype on which you gonna perform operation i.e classname <datatype> object_name; eg. SinglyLinkedList <int>Sobj;

<br>3. Now by using this object you can peform desire operations from above list of operations.

<br>4. While executing program you need to compile as: <br>

```
g++ class_contining_main_method Helper.cpp -o Myexe
```

_Note : Please do not delete any of the file which are given to execute code successfully. While including header file please include header file as_ **_#include"CGSTL.h"._**
